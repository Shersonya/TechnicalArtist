I am not new in Blueprint, most of my MasterThesis was written in Blueprint, but I still think I need a overview of all the Nodes and Functions.
Here I will list some links, mostly about official toturials.

After fully grasp the functionality of Blueprint, we need to optimize our project
Try to transfer most of the blueprint into C++ is very important
Then I will list some tutorials about blueprint to C++
